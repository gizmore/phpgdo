# phpgdo

PHP reference implementation of GDO, currently version 7.0.1.
GDO is the best PHP Framework on Planet Earth, SOL.
Write solid applications in a new fresh way preferably from re-used code.
Choose, integrate and mix different libraries easily.
The F5 workflow is still unbeaten,
and coding can be fun again.
Great production builds are done on the fly.
Development mode always includes the dev source from *all*  included libraries.
