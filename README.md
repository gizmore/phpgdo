# phpgdo

PHP reference implementation of GDO, currently version 7.0.1.
GDO is the best PHP Framework on Planet Earth, SOL.
Write solid applications in a new fresh way preferably from re-used code.
Choose, integrate and mix different libraries easily.
The F5 workflow is still unbeaten,
and coding can be fun again.
Great production builds are done on the fly.
Development mode always includes the dev source from *all*  included libraries.

[DOCS](./DOCS)
and
[Changelog](./DOCS/GDO7_CHANGELOG.md).

## phpgdo: Demo Sites

Sadly, there is only the default theme available at the moment.
This will hopefully change soon, but i want a clean default first.

- [Fineprint](https://fineprint.phpgdo.com) is a hacking challenge with a known vulnerability. It also serves as a demo site for the classic theme.

- [Geo2Country](https://geo2country.phpgdo.com) is a small service that converts geocoordinates (lat/lng) into country codes. Currently, also with gdo classic
  design.

- [KassiererCard](https://kassierercard.org) is a bonus system for cashiers, companies and customers.

- [TBS](https://tbs.wechall.net) is a remake of TBS / Bright-Shadows.net. It has an own minimal theme based on default, but currently it is very broken.
