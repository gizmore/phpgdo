## GDOv7 Profiler: Own Metrics

GDOv7 does report own Metrics to the clients.

There is the core module [Module_Perf](../GDO/Perf/) to provide these.

For HTTP, there are X-GDO-* headers on every request served by GDOv7;
Memory and Timing information is availble there.

@TODO: What about CLI/Chat performance metrics?


## GDOv7 Profiler: XDebug.

@TODO add profiler instructions. Create a repo with qkachgrind binaries for easy windows setup.


## GDOv7 Profiler: Code Coverage

@TODO research code coverage tools. Write a module to aid with cc.
