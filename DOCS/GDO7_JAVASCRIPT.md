# GDOv7 Javascript

This is a guideline and documentation for Javascript in GDOv7.


## GDOv7 Javascript: Asset Pipeline

GDOv7 does not have an asset pipeline.
You press F5 to deliver the latest assets, which are the files you work on.

For real production builds, use the
[Javascript](https://github.com/gizmore/phpgdo-javascript)
module.
This is still just pressing F5, but the javascript gets minified on the fly.
Source files are forbidden to be delivered in this mode.
