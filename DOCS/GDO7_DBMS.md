# GDOv7 DBMS

[GDOv7 DBAL](../) are all handcrafted carefully
and should be a tad faster than anything you have seen.
In GDOv7 there is not a single way to achieve things...
there is *only one single way*!
Currently only [MySQL/MariaDB](https://github.com/gizmore/) is supported,´but plans for other DBMS are made.


## GDOv7 DBMS: MySQL/MariaDB

Currently only this DBMS is supported.


## GDOv7 DBMS: Postgres (planned 7.0.4)


## GDOv7 DBMS: SQLite (planned 7.0.3)
